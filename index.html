            <p>I am a full stack flex web developer student at University of Oregon. I love to spend my free time hiking, playing video games, going on road trips while listing to music. I have a beautiful daughter named Eevee, thats her in the picture. I joined the Marine Corps on December 05, 2016 with a eight year contract. I have done a year and a half on contruction. I have been in security for six years in multiple companies. I went to Portland Community College for a year and a half but have yet to finish for my associates.</p>
            <p>Hiking is a new activity I have been doing as of 2022. I have been to six hikes so far. My favorate mountain to hike was the Dog Mountain because it was the most challenging. Took 4 hours to finish and arrive back to my car.</p>
            <p>I started playing video games at the young age of eight years old. I started with Pokemon on the gameboy, emerald version. My longest played and still my favorate game is League of Legends. I have a gaming laptop and a Playstation 4.</p>
